# RDF surfaces tests

Contains the test examples in the repository [rdfsurface-tests](https://github.com/eyereasoner/rdfsurfaces-tests/tree/94eb1b74c70b51f34f67b15d59e8e02ebaf4a96b) of the reasoning engine EYE.

A single example `peano_s.n3s` was added manually and is not part of the test examples in the repository. However, it was derived from the contained `peano.n3s`.

Here they are divided into:
- Examples that are supported by rs2fol
- Examples that are not supported due to special syntax, built-ins, Skolem variables, neutral surfaces, etc.
